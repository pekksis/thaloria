**Goldsight Eye**  *Requires attunement*
This golden, gem-encrusted monocle enhances your perception of the hidden and arcane.
- **Enhanced Vision:** You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks to examine objects and discern illusions.

    - **Detect Evil and Good**
    - **Detect Magic**
    - **Detect Poison and Disease**
    - **Identify**

**Amulet of Elemental Summoning** *Requires attunement*
This amulet is adorned with a swirling gemstone that flickers with elemental energy, attuned to the primal forces of nature.
- **Summon Elemental:** While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to summon an elemental creature. The summoned elemental must have a Challenge Rating of 1/2 or lower, such as a steam mephit, magma mephit, or dust mephit.
    - The elemental appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you, acts immediately after your turn, and obeys your verbal commands.
    - The elemental does not require concentration to maintain but is unstable, lasting for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points.
- **Recharge:** Once you use this ability, the amulet cannot be used again until the next dawn.

**Aetherheart Amulet** 
This delicate necklace holds a small aether crystal that shimmers faintly with magical energy. The crystal's enchantment is designed to preserve life in moments of great peril.
- **Automatic Activation:** The amulet monitors the wearer’s vital signs. When the wearer is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, the aether crystal automatically casts the _Healing Word_ spell on the wearer (1d4 + 4 healing). Once activated, the amulet’s mechanism shatters, and the item becomes unusable.
- **Manual Use:** As an alternative, the wearer can remove the aether crystal and use it as a spell scroll to cast _Healing Word_ (1d4 + 4 healing) on themselves or an ally within 60 feet. Doing so also renders the amulet unusable.
- **One-Time Use:** The amulet’s enchantment is consumed upon activation, whether automatically or manually.
